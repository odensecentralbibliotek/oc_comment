# Odense central library comment module.
Builds on the original comments module but adds/changes several features.

1. Works better with panels.
2. Simplified threading (migth eventual use van-numbers , but they seem overly complex compared with gains).
3. Enabled or disable comment/reply size limit with dynamic counter.
4. Rules based notifcations.
6. Allows sorting of top level and child comments(ASC or DESC).
7. Hide or show comment replies by default.
8. Uses ajax based pageing
9. Ajax based reply/edit/delete/publish

how to use:

Enable the module and add the two blocks to the panels where you want to show comments.
For sites that do not use panels additional work may be required to hide the original comment module.
